# Snake Game Neuroevolution Bugfix for the Week of 5/1 - 5/7

## Issue Summary
The Snake Game with Neuroevolution visualization wasn't displaying anything on the screen due to multiple syntax errors and structural issues in the code.

## Problems Identified
1. **Syntax Errors in the Rendering Loop**:
   - Mismatched brackets and parentheses in the `display()` method
   - Improper closure of code blocks causing rendering failure

2. **Duplicate Function Declarations**:
   - `drawVisionForSnake()` was defined twice with similar functionality
   - `getAverageScore()` was defined twice with identical code

3. **Animation Loop Issues**:
   - Problems with the `requestAnimationFrame()` implementation
   - Improper nested code blocks breaking the rendering cycle

## Fixes Applied
1. **Code Structure Repair**:
   - Fixed bracket matching and code block structure
   - Properly organized the `display()` method
   - Ensured consistent indentation and code organization

2. **Duplicate Function Removal**:
   - Removed duplicate implementations of `drawVisionForSnake()`
   - Removed duplicate implementations of `getAverageScore()`

3. **Animation Loop Correction**:
   - Fixed the animation loop using `requestAnimationFrame()`
   - Ensured proper context binding for animation callbacks

4. **Generated Clean Version**:
   - Created a fully repaired version of `game.js`
   - Maintained all original functionality while fixing syntax issues
   - Fixed error-causing code without changing the core algorithm

## Results
The game now successfully renders and displays:
- Grid with obstacles
- Snake movement and growth
- Neuroevolution visualization 
- Vision rays for the best-performing snake
- Top-performing snakes with visual distinction

## Backup Process
- Original file backed up as `game.js.backup`
- Fixed version saved as `game.js`

## Lessons Learned
1. Bracket matching and code structure are critical for JavaScript rendering
2. Duplicate function declarations can cause unpredictable behavior
3. Animation loops need proper context binding with arrow functions or bound callbacks
4. Visual debugging by creating a clean version can be more effective than incremental fixes in complex cases
